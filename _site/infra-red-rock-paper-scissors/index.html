Reflective listening is a crucial communication technique where the listener paraphrases their conversation partner’s message to foster deeper understanding and connection (similarly to the smoking cessation AI chatbot). Our project leverages advanced AI technology to assist users in mastering this skill, enhancing their overall communication effectiveness. Certificate of Distinction: I’m proud to share that our team, Capstone Team 2023692, was awarded a Certificate of Distinction for our outstanding work on the ConvoAssistant project. This recognition was a testament to our innovative approach, technical proficiency, and dedication to enhancing reflective listening skills through advanced AI technology. Receiving this certificate not only validated our hard work and collaboration but also underscored the impact of our project in the field of communication enhancement. Project Objectives: The primary objective of the project was to create an application that aids users in developing reflective listening skills through two distinct modes:    Real-Time Assistant (RTA) Mode: This mode assists users during live conversations by providing reflective statements based on the ongoing dialogue. It is designed for deep, thoughtful conversations where users have time to consider their responses. Specifically, it listens to a verbal conversation and suggests responses through the user’s earbuds.     Practice Mode: This mode generates scenarios for users to practice reflective listening. After reflecting on these scenarios, the application evaluates the user’s responses and offers constructive feedback for improvement.  Implementation: The application serves as a verbal interface for a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI’s GPT-3. 5 turbo model. Here’s a breakdown of the technical implementation:    Audio Input and Output: The application takes audio input from the user, converts it to text, and processes it using the LLM. The generated text response is then converted back to audio to be played aloud to the user.     Speaker Diarization: In RTA Mode, Google Cloud’s Speech diarization platform is utilized to identify distinct speakers within a conversation, ensuring accurate reflective statements.     Feedback Mechanism: In Practice Mode, the application not only evaluates the user’s reflective responses but also provides suggestions for improvement, fostering a continuous learning environment.     Android Application: The application was developed using Kotlin within an Android Studio Project.  ![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image. png?w=300)Android Application InterfaceDevelopment and Evaluation: The project development followed a structured approach, with regular updates and milestones tracked through Gantt charts. We adhered to strict requirements and specifications to ensure the application’s functionality, responsiveness, and efficiency. The final product was thoroughly tested and passed evaluations with high marks for both response time and accuracy. Key Contributions:    Design and Implementation: Participated in designing the android application’s architecture and implementing key features such as audio processing and integration with GPT-3. 5 turbo.     Testing and Evaluation: Conducted extensive testing to ensure the application met performance benchmarks and provided accurate, timely responses.     User Experience: Focused on creating an intuitive user interface that facilitates seamless interaction, making it easy for users to engage with the application in both modes.  Outcome: ConvoAssistant successfully accomplishes its goal of facilitating reflective listening in users, providing a practical tool for improving communication skills. The project showcases my ability to apply advanced AI technology to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences. Conclusion: This project exemplifies the intersection of technology and communication, demonstrating how AI can be harnessed to improve essential interpersonal skills. ![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/poster. png?w=1024)Final Project Poster"

    "body": "2021/11/08 - I took a mechanical engineering design course to feed my curiosity, and expand my breadth of knowledge in the field of robotics. Whether I have to design some simple mechanical parts, or work with mechanical engineers in a robotics context, I will be well equipped. I found the course extremely interesting. Through hands on projects, I learned how to design machines from a mechanical design perspective, and how to bring those ideas to life in CAD (Computer Aided Design) software like SolidWorks. In fact, I was able to pass the CSWA (Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate) test with flying colors, becoming SolidWorks certified. Dissections: During the semester, we had group dissections, where we dissected existing mechanisms to better understand them. We cadded the mechanisms using SolidWorks, modified them, and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses. We also learned to make engineering drawings both by hand, and using solidworks. ![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1. gif?w=310)One of the assemblies I made in SolidWorks for an electric screwdriver![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-12. png?w=1024)An engineering drawing I made in SolidWorksLater in the course, we designed our own gearbox and had it 3D printed. I was well prepared for this due to my previous experience with 3D printing. We had to print our parts within a strict printing time limit. This limited the amount of material we could print. However, we were able to use this limited material to still make a relatively durable design. ![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-10. png?w=465)Casing DesignThe final result was a simple elegant design that met all the design specification, ready weeks in advance of the deadline. ![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-11. png?w=1024)3D Printed Final Dissection DesignDesigning a CNC Mill: The overarching project in this course was to design our own CNC milling machine. My team used everything we had learned in this course, from specific mechanisms to the engineering design process as a whole. Before we had learned to use SolidWorks, I used tinkerCAD to make some simple candidate designs. ![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-13. png?w=482)My candidate design made in tinkerCADAfter many iterations of candidate designs, as well as mechanism selection, my team was able to start creating our final design. We modelled this final design in SolidWorks, using both our own original parts, and parts supplied by manufacturer websites. I worked on multiple subsystems, including the movement axes, the frame, and the automatic tool changer. ![](https://marcmorcos. wordpress. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image. png?w=880)Final Assembly (with protective acrylic cover removed)The final result was a full CAD for the CNC machine, which was thoroughly analyzed to ensure that all requirements were met and/or exceeded.
