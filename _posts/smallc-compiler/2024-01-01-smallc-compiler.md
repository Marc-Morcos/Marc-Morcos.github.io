In my ECE467 (compilers) class, I undertook the development of a compiler for a subset of C, termed SmallC. This comprehensive project not only tested my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of compiler construction and optimization techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Grammar Definition and Parser Implementation:**
    - Created a formal grammar for SmallC and implemented a robust parser using ANTLR4.
    
    - Translated parsed code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), laying the foundation for subsequent processing steps.

3. **Semantic Checker in C++:**
    - Developed a semantic checker in C++ to ensure code adherence to SmallC language standards.
    
    - This step was crucial in identifying and rectifying potential errors before code generation.

5. **Intermediate Code Generation:**
    - Generated intermediate code from the validated AST, a pivotal step in making the code platform-independent.
    
    - Set the stage for further optimization and eventual translation to machine-specific code.

7. **Insights into Optimization Techniques:**
    - Learned about optimization passes, gaining insights into how compilers enhance code efficiency.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Holistic Understanding of Compilation Process:**
    - Gained a comprehensive understanding of the compilation process from parsing and semantic checking to code generation and optimization.
    
    - Developed skills to address challenges at each stage of the compiler pipeline.

- **Impact on Coding Practices:**
    - Acquired valuable insights into how code is compiled and optimized, directly influencing my day-to-day coding practices.
    
    - Strengthened ability to write efficient and optimized code by leveraging compiler principles.

**Conclusion:**

The SmallC Compiler project in ECE467 was a pivotal experience that sharpened my programming and problem-solving skills while providing a holistic understanding of the intricate compilation process. This endeavor not only expanded my knowledge in compiler construction but also equipped me with practical insights applicable to future coding endeavors.
