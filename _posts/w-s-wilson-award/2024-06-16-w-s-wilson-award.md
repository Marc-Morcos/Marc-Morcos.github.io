I am happy to announce that I am the recipient of the University of Torontoâ€™s W.S. Wilson Medal, awarded to the student with the highest final year average in computer engineering. Reflecting on my journey at UofT, I am incredibly grateful for the friends, mentors and experiences that have shaped me. Without them, this accomplishment would not have been possible.
