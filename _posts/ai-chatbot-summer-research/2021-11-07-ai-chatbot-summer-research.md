**Research Scholarship: AI Chatbots for Smoking Cessation**

In recognition of my outstanding academic performance, I was awarded a research scholarship at the University of Toronto, where I collaborated with Professor Jonathan Rose in a groundbreaking project. Our mission was to leverage AI chatbots to assist individuals in quitting smoking. This immersive experience not only delved into the intricacies of artificial intelligence (AI) but also required a fusion of software development and therapeutic techniques.

**Key Contributions and Learnings:**

1. **Self-Taught Development:**
    - With the goal of creating an interface for users to interact with the chatbot, I taught myself Javascript and REACT.
    
    - Designed, debugged, and implemented the backend, utilizing Python and frameworks like Flask, while integrating AWS services for seamless functionality.

3. **AI Model Fine-Tuning:**
    - Undertook the challenge of fine-tuning a natural language processing AI using the HuggingFace Python library.
    
    - Achieved a remarkable 84% utterance accuracy, a substantial improvement from the initial 12%, showcasing the effectiveness of the refined model.

**Software Development Growth:**

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):**
    - Acquired hands-on experience with various AWS services, including Elastic Beanstalk, Sagemaker, and Amplify.
    
    - Grew as a software developer, navigating the complexities of cloud-based infrastructure and deployment.

- **Full-Stack Development:**
    - Engaged in full-stack development, seamlessly integrating frontend and backend components to deliver a cohesive user experience.
    
    - Strengthened skills in Python (PyTorch and transformers), Javascript, and React/ReactJS, broadening my programming repertoire.

**AI Mastery and Career Implications:**

- **Conceptual Understanding:**
    - Delved into the fundamentals of AI, learning the basics and practical aspects, including the utilization of PyTorch for AI model development.
    
    - Applied Motivational Interviewing techniques, merging therapeutic principles with AI to create a supportive environment for smoking cessation.

- **Future Path in AI:**
    - The summer research experience served as a stepping stone for my venture into AI, offering a solid foundation in both theory and application.
    
    - The newfound knowledge and skills set the stage for a promising career in AI, providing a holistic perspective on development, deployment, and fine-tuning of AI models.

**Conclusion:**

My summer research at UofT was a transformative experience that amalgamated software development and AI in a meaningful way. From crafting a user-friendly chatbot interface to achieving significant improvements in AI model accuracy, this project not only broadened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the potential applications of AI in therapeutic contexts. As I continue to explore the realm of AI, the lessons learned during this research scholarship will undoubtedly shape my contributions to the field.
