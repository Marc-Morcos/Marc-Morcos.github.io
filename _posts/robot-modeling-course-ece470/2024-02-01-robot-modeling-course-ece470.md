In the ECE470 course, I was immersed in an exploration of robot modeling, forward and inverse kinematics for robot arms. This course delves into the intricate mechanics of robotic systems, offering valuable insights into their design and movement.

In the course's labs, I got to create path planning code for the robot to draw images. For example, I got the robot to draw a self-portrait on paper.

In another lab, I used the artificial potential method to do path planning, picking up an object and avoiding obstacles to place it at a goal position.

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Robot Modeling:**
    - Acquiring a deep understanding of the principles and methodologies involved in modeling robot arms.
    
    - Exploring various modeling techniques to represent the dynamics and geometry of robotic systems.

3. **Forward and Inverse Kinematics:**
    - Delving into forward kinematics to predict the end-effector's position based on joint variables.
    
    - Unraveling the complexities of inverse kinematics to determine the required joint configurations for a desired end-effector position.

5. **Path Planning Challenges:**
    - Tackling the complexities of path planning in the context of robot arms.
    
    - Engaging with the nuances of gradient descent to navigate a path laden with obstacles, fostering problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios.
