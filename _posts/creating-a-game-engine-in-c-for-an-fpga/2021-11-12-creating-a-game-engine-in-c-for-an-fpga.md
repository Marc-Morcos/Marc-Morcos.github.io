In the ECE243 computer organization course, I delved into the intricacies of graphics programming from scratch on an FPGA board, a journey that provided invaluable insights into low-level computer graphics and driver operations. My teammate and I, despite the challenges of remote learning, took on the semester project with enthusiasm, creating an engaging Asteroids game that went beyond the curriculum.

**Key Achievements and Contributions:**

1. **Multilayered Graphics Programming:**
    - Explored graphics programming in both assembly (ARM V7) and C code, using low level commands to generate a game and interact with the board's IO.
    
    - Developed a feature-rich Asteroids game, leveraging the features of the FPGA board to implement stereo audio, particle effects, and additional displays for lives and scores.

3. **Extra Features:**
    - Enriched the gaming experience by incorporating stereo audio, providing a more immersive dimension to the project.
    
    - Implemented complementary LED and 7-segment displays to showcase lives and scores.
