Between grade 9 and 10, my fascination with 3D printing led me to embark on a challenging yet rewarding endeavor â€“ building my original 3D printer from a Kickstarter kit. Despite being a novice at the time and facing numerous mechanical and electrical challenges within the kit, I persevered. Through meticulous troubleshooting and a deep dive into 3D printing best practices, I successfully addressed the issues and achieved the capability to print basic shapes.
