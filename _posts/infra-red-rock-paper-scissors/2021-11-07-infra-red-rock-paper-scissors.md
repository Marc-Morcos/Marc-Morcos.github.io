*Displaying the "scissors" symbol to the infra red sensor*

For our final project in grade 12 coding class, my team and I had the freedom to choose any project. Drawing inspiration from my previous experience with an infrared sensor in creating a virtual reality headset, we embarked on a journey to repurpose the sensor for an engaging and interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

**Key Project Highlights:**

1. **Infrared Sensor Integration:**
    - Leveraged an infrared sensor to simultaneously scan multiple people's hands, detecting whether they formed the rock, paper, or scissors symbol.

3. **Computer Vision Implementation:**
    - Developed code using a computer vision library in Python to accurately detect the number of fingers presented by each participant.
    
    - Gained a foundational understanding of computer vision, laying the groundwork for future endeavors in robotics.

**Skills Acquired:**

- **Computer Vision Proficiency:**
    - Used a computer vision library in Python to interpret visual data, a skill with direct applications in robotics and automation.
    
    - The ability to detect hand gestures for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game showcased practical knowledge in computer vision.

- **Multifaceted Coding Abilities:**
    - Expanded coding skills by learning how to open images and incorporate sound elements using Python.
    
    - This multifaceted approach enriched my capabilities as a software developer, emphasizing both image processing and auditory feedback.

**Preparation for Robotics Career:**

- **Foundational Robotics Skills:**
    - The introduction to computer vision through this project laid the groundwork for skills essential in the field of robotics.
    
    - Understanding how to interpret visual data is a fundamental aspect of robotics, making this project a valuable preparatory experience.

- **Holistic Development:**
    - Expanding beyond the core task of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, the project enabled me to explore various facets of software development, from hardware integration to image processing and audio feedback.

**Conclusion:**

The Infrared Rock, Paper, Scissors project in my grade 12 coding class was more than a creative coding endeavor; it was a testament to the practical application of skills and the exploration of emerging technologies. The fusion of infrared sensors, computer vision, and Python coding not only resulted in an entertaining game but also provided me with foundational knowledge crucial for my future in robotics. As I pursue a career in software development, this project will remain a significant milestone in my journey of continuous learning and innovation.
