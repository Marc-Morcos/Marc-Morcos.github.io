I'm a computer engineering graduate with a keen interest in software development and robotics.

I taught myself C++ through YouTube tutorials at a young age, sparking a passion for programming. Over the years, this passion has grown, as I've worked on various personal projects, including 3D printers, Raspberry Pi-based robotics, an infrared camera rock-paper-scissors program, and DIY VR headsets.

During my Computer Engineering degree at the University of Toronto, I was immersed in coursework covering software, hardware, and mechanical engineering. Achieving the highest fourth-year grade in the Computer engineering department for my year, and obtaining a minor in robotics and a certificate in AI, reflects my commitment to academic excellence.

As a former intern at Epson, I played active roles in robotics, AI, and software development. I took ownership of three tools, extended other ROS-based tools, converted experimental technologies into practical solutions, and presented innovative ideas to the department.

I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills further, always excited about learning new technologies and meeting new people.
